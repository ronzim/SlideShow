# SlideShow

A three js carrousel of slides

## How to setup

Just run `npm install`.  
Then place your slides into the ./slides/ folder, in a format that can be loaded into a texture (jpg, png, ...).  
Name the slides as {name}-1, {name}-2, etc...

A texturized plane will be created for each slide.

## How to use it

Run `npm start` and move around with following controls:

- Left click on a slide to go fullscreen
- Arrow keys to move to the next / previous slide
- Right click to go back to slide overview
